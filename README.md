# 👋 Hi, I’m Relanxio

I’m exploring **IT, automation, and system reliability**, building hands-on scripts and small projects to improve workflows and troubleshooting.

## 🔧 Skills in Progress
- Bash & Python scripting  
- API testing & automation (Postman, pytest)  
- System monitoring & troubleshooting  
- Basic networking & log analysis  
- SQL for data handling and IT asset management  

## 📂 Projects
> Currently building and experimenting — more projects will be added as I learn.

- **System Health Check** – Scripts to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and service uptime.  
- **API Lab** – Automated API testing and troubleshooting.  
- **IT Playbooks** – Documentation and best practices for troubleshooting and automation.  
- **IT Asset Database** – Example SQL scripts and queries to manage IT assets or logs.  

## 📈 Learning Goals
- Expand knowledge of network diagnostics and automation  
- Build test automation frameworks for APIs and system monitoring  
- Improve documentation and workflow organization
